    <h2>What is a class selector in CSS?</h2>
    <p>In CSS, a class selector is formatted as a period (.) character followed by the name of the class. It selects all
        elements with that class attribute so that unique CSS declarations can be applied to those specific elements
        without affecting other elements on the page.</p>
