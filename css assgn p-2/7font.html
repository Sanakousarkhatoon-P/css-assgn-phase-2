    <h2>Font Properties</h2>
    <p>CSS font properties allow the developers to manipulate how the font will look and feel on the webpage. The size,
        style, color, and much more can be changed by using properties. For e.g., if the developer wants to make a part
        of the text more impactful, he/she can BOLD the part.

        Similarly, if anyone wants to change to font style from normal(straight) ones to italics (tilted), it can also
        be achieved. There are numerous things possible by making changes in the font properties. And for that, we need
        to learn about the different font properties in CSS.</p>
